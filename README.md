## Tools used in this application:

**Main:**
### `Sanity` - as a database for products storage
### `Stripe` - as a payment system
**Other less important stuff:**
### `React Toast` - for beautiful notifications 
### `Canvas confetti` - for confetti effect after successful payment
### `React Icons` - icons

This is not a commercial project, it was made just to showcase my skills.
